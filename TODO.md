# TODO

- I'm currently working on the indexing feature
  - I have the change detection working right now

Now I should start on the basic query implementation

- [ ] take the list of nodes and insert them into the db
  - [ ] map them to format expected by db
- [ ] RawQuery command that we sanitize for any destructive operations
