This document contains a log of my current train of thought

## 06 Saturday

  - I'm currently implementing a function for retrieving all documents
    that match some prefix.
  - might actually skip it now though.
  - I need id suffix matching for "start writing document title" ->
    "full document id" autocomplete.
    - sooooo, for the LSP, and not for the cli
    - for the lsp some in-memory datastructure might be better (as
      long as it is memory efficient).
  - I shall now continue on the "Raw query" instead
